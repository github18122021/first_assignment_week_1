    <h1>Stitches - Song Lyrics</h1>
<!-- Lyrics starts from here-->
<p>I thought that I'd been hurt before</p>
<p>But no one's ever left me quite this sore</p>
<p>Your words cut deeper than a knife</p>
<p>Now I need someone to breathe me back to life</p>
<p>Got a feeling that I'm going under</p>
<p>But I know that I'll make it out alive</p>
<p>If I quit calling you my lover</p>
<p>Move on</p>
<p>You watch me bleed until I can't breathe</p>
<p>Shaking, falling onto my knees</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
<p>Tripping over myself</p>
<p>Aching, begging you to come help</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
<p>Just like a moth drawn to a flame</p>
<p>Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain</p>
<p>Your bitter heart, cold to the touch</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna reap what I sow</p>
<p>I'm left seeing red on my own</p>
<p>Got a feeling that I'm going under</p>
<p>But I know that I'll make it out alive</p>
<p>If I quit calling you my lover</p>
<p>Move on</p>
<p>You watch me bleed until I can't breathe</p>
<p>Shaking, falling onto my knees</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
<p>Tripping over myself</p>
<p>Aching, begging you to come help</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (gonna wind up dead)</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head (gotta get you outta my head)</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (wind up dead)</p>
<p>Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head, get you outta my head</p>
<p>You watch me bleed until I can't breathe</p>
<p>Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses (without you)</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)</p>
<p>Tripping over myself</p>
<p>Aching, begging you to come help (begging baby, please)</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
<p>And now that I'm without your kisses</p>
<p>I'll be needing stitches</p>
